// The Link component enables client-side navigation between two pages in the same Next.js app.
// Client-side navigation means that the page transition happens using JavaScript, which is faster than the default navigation done by the browser.
//for example if i changed the background color using chrome dev tools it would persist! 
//in production builds, whenever Link components appear in the browserâ€™s viewport, Next.js automatically prefetches the code for the linked page in the background. By the time you click the link, the code for the destination page will already be loaded in the background, and the page transition will be near-instant!
// Note: If you need to link to an external page outside the Next.js app, just use an <a> tag without Link.
// If you need to add attributes like, for example, className, add it to the a tag, not to the Link tag.
